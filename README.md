- **Median**: The middle value in a list of numbers.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value.
- **Variance**: Measure of the spread between numbers in a data set.
- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance, shows how much variation exists from the mean.

### **2. Probability Theory 🎲**
- **Random Variables**: Variables whose values depend on outcomes of a random phenomenon.
- **Probability Distribution**: A function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes.
- **Bayes' Theorem**: Describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.
- **Expectation (Expected Value)**: The weighted average of all possible values a random variable can take.

### **3. Linear Algebra 📐**
- **Scalars**: Single numbers.
- **Vectors**: Ordered lists of numbers.
- **Matrices**: Rectangular arrays of numbers.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Combining two matrices to produce a new matrix.
- **Determinant**: A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: Scalars and vectors associated with a matrix that provide insights into its properties.

### **4. Calculus 📏**
- **Derivatives**: Measure how a function changes as its input changes.
- **Partial Derivatives**: Derivatives of functions with multiple variables.
- **Gradient**: Vector of partial derivatives, indicates the direction of the steepest increase of a function.
- **Integration**: Opposite of differentiation, sums up parts to find the whole.

### **5. Optimization 📈**
- **Gradient Descent**: Iterative algorithm for finding the minimum of a function.
- **Cost Function (Loss Function)**: Measures how well a model's predictions match the actual data.
- **Convergence**: When the algorithm reaches a minimum value of the cost function.

### **6. Probability Distributions 📉**
- **Normal Distribution**: Bell-shaped distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution.
- **Binomial Distribution**: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of trials.
- **Poisson Distribution**: Describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval.

### **7. Hypothesis Testing 🔍**
- **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference.
- **p-value**: The probability of obtaining results at least as extreme as the observed results, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
- **Confidence Interval**: A range of values, derived from the sample, that is likely to contain the value of an unknown population parameter.

### **8. Regression Analysis 📏**
- **Linear Regression**: Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Multiple Regression**: Extension of linear regression that uses multiple variables to predict the outcome.
- **R-squared**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

### **9. Machine Learning Algorithms 🤖**
- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms that learn from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms that learn from unlabeled data.
- **Classification**: Predicting a category or class.
- **Regression**: Predicting a continuous value.
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar items together.

### **10. Data Preprocessing 🧹**
- **Normalization**: Scaling data to fit within a specific range.
- **Standardization**: Scaling data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Filling in missing data points with estimated values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.

### **11. Model Evaluation 📉**
- **Cross-Validation**: Technique to evaluate the model by splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to describe the performance of a classification model.
- **Precision and Recall**: Metrics for evaluating classification models.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### **12. Dimensionality Reduction 🌐**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Technique to reduce the dimensionality of the data by transforming to a new set of variables.
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique for visualization.

These concepts form the foundation of machine learning and data science. Understanding them is crucial for developing robust and effective models. Happy learning! 🚀📚
